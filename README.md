# Arma3-Modlist-Splicer
It combines multiple Arma3 HTML mod lists into one.

What is this program?
It combines multiple Arma3 HTML mod lists into one.

It strips away the html headers from any file in '\Mod Pack Splicer\CombineThese', leaving only the mods.
It then combines any of these stripped files in '\Mod Pack Splicer\CombineThese' into '\Mod Pack Splicer\Output\CombinedOutput.html'
That file can now be imported into the Arma3 launcher.
If you inspect the html in a browser or text viewer, you'll notice my application did not remove duplicates - arma3 doesnt care about duplicates, so for simplicity neither did I.

How to use?
Place the modlists you would like combined into '\Mod Pack Splicer\CombineThese'.
Run/double click the 'Mod Pack Splicer' application.
Check '\Mod Pack Splicer\Output' for a new file 'Combined output'
